/**
 * @brief Constructs a directed DiGraph from a series-parallel decomposition.
 *
 * @details The transformation is performed recursively as follows:
 * - Nodes in the decomposition remain the same in the resulting graph.
 * - For serial composition between graphs, an all-to-all connection is created
 * between the terminal nodes of one graph and the initial nodes of the
 * following one.
 * - For parallel composition between graphs, the union of the graphs is taken
 * without adding any additional edges.
