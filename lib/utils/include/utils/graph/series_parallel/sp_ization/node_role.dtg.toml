# Enum to categorize the role of each node in the 2 following spization algorithms:
# - escribano_algo
# - flexible_sync
# PURE: Original nodes from the input graph.
# SYNC: Synchronization nodes added by the algorithm. A sync node s expresses an
#   all-to-all connection: all "up" nodes have an edge to s, and s has an edge to
#   all "down" nodes. These nodes are contracted out at the end of the algorithm.
# DUMMY: Needed for the node-by-node version of the escribano algorithm. These nodes
#   are added such that, for every edge (n1, n2), the difference in depth between
#   n1 and n2 is at most 1 (we do this by taking all the edges where the difference
#   in depth between the 2 nodes is greater than 1, and we "break up" that edge
#   into a chain of dummy nodes). These nodes are contracted out at the end of the
#   algorithm.
